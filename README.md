# Simple-Blog-web-app-using-ASP.NET

Blog uses ASP.NET core to add and edit a blog post. 
I grabbed an HTML Editor from https://froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/ and used the Vapor theme from https://bootswatch.com/ to make it look pretty. 

Currently, it only saves to a List but I do plan on switching over to a SQL server at some point.
